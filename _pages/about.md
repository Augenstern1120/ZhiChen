I'm Zhi Chen, currently a graduate student at the School of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Jiangsu Normal University. My research interests lie in deep learning and artificial intelligence, particularly focusing on cross-device adaptability and optimization under low-resource conditions.

### Research Experience

- **Cross-Device Low-Resource Acoustic Scene Classification**  
  At Tsinghua University's Speech and Audio Technology Lab, I developed DS-FlexiNet, which integrates depthwise separable convolutions from MobileNetV2 and residual connections from ResNet to address efficient acoustic scene classification under resource constraints. This work led to a publication in ICASSP 2025.

- **IMU-Based Human Motion Capture**  
  Completed at Jiangsu Normal University, this project involved sensor ellipsoid fitting correction, data preprocessing, and pedestrian dead reckoning for accurate human posture reconstruction using Unity 3D.

- **Other Projects**  
  Included industrial fan detection based on acoustics, multimodal emotion recognition, audio tampering detection, and Chinese word segmentation.

- Published: "Improving Acoustic Scene Classification in Low-Resource Conditions" (ICASSP 2025).

### Future Research Interests
In pursuit of a PhD, I aim to further explore:
- Cross-device adaptability and low-resource optimization.
- Multimodal acoustic scene classification combined with speech recognition.
- Dialect and second language speech recognition.
- Pathological speech corpus construction and pronunciation recognition for individuals with speech disorders.
