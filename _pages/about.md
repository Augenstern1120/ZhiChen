I'm Zhi Chen, currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University (ECNU).

### Research Experience

- **Cross-Device Low-Resource Acoustic Scene Classification**  
  At Tsinghua University's Speech and Audio Technology Lab, I developed DS-FlexiNet, which integrates depthwise separable convolutions from MobileNetV2 and residual connections from ResNet to address efficient acoustic scene classification under resource constraints. This work led to a publication in ICASSP 2025.

- **Industrial Fan Detection Based on Acousticse**  
  Led the development of a deep learning fault detection system for industrial fans, from data collection to model deployment with Pytorch's CP-ResNet. Applied FMS and ADIR for data augmentation, ensuring robust model performance through comprehensive testing.

- **Audio Tampering Detection**  
  Developed methods to identify audio file alterations and locate tampering points. Responsibilities included data preprocessing, framework setup, and experimental validation.

- **Chinese Word Segmentation and Classification**  
  Implemented NLP tasks focusing on dividing text into lexical units and classifying them. Tasks covered framework setup, experimental validation, and comparative analysis.

- **IMU-Based Human Motion Capture**  
  Completed at Jiangsu Normal University, this project involved sensor ellipsoid fitting correction, data preprocessing, and pedestrian dead reckoning for accurate human posture reconstruction using Unity 3D.

- **Published**  
- Published: Improving Acoustic Scene Classification in Low-Resource Conditions (CCF-B, ICASSP 2025).


### Future Research Interests
- Cross-device adaptability and low-resource optimization, including adaptive data augmentation based on audio characteristics (e.g., SNR, frequency distribution).
- Multimodal acoustic scene classification combined with speech recognition, integrating AED and ASC to improve scene identification accuracy.
- Open category identification strategies for robust cross-device, low-resource conditions.
- Dialect and second language speech recognition, focusing on enhancing understanding and pronunciation accuracy.
- Pathological speech corpus construction and pronunciation recognition, aiming to assist individuals with speech disorders.
